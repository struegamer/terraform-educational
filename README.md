# Terraform Educational Projects

This is just for educational purposes.

# Pre-Requisites

This project is using the terraform-libvirt provider, which you can
find [here](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt)

On Mac OS X you need to compile it yourself, or wait until I wrote the
`homebrew` formula.
